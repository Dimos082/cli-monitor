# CLI Monitor üñ•Ô∏è 

> **CLI Monitor** is a *cross-platform* Python tool that repeatedly runs a command, captures its output, optionally logs it, and can even trigger a secondary command whenever a regex pattern is matched.

*Because repetitive tasks should be automated...*

**Unittests status for Win/Lin/Mac environments:** [![Python Multi-OS Tests](https://github.com/Dimos082/cli-monitor/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Dimos082/cli-monitor/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Overview <a id="overview"></a>

CLI Monitor is designed to help automate command execution, log outputs, and monitor for specific patterns using **regex**. If a match is found, the tool can execute an additional command. It handles logging, error reporting, and summary generation with ease.

## Features <a id="features"></a>

- **Flexible Command Execution**: Run any CLI command at a chosen frequency.
- **Pattern Matching with Regex**: Detect specific output patterns and trigger follow-up actions.
- **Smart Log Management**: Automatically rotate logs to prevent excessive file sizes.
- **Auto-Stop Timer**: Set a duration for execution or let it run indefinitely.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS with Python 3.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Quick Start <a id="quick-start"></a>

1. **Download** [cli_monitor.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dimos082/cli-monitor/refs/heads/main/cli_monitor.py). **Or clone:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dimos082/cli-monitor.git
   cd cli-monitor
   ```
3. **Run with an argument**:
   ```bash
   python cli_monitor.py --command "echo Hello"
   ```
4. **Stop** it at any time (e.g., Ctrl + C) or specify a timer with `--timer`.
5. **Check** the summary in terminal (or in log file if `--output-file` specified) after. Example:
```bash
----- Execution Summary -----
Start Time: 2025-01-04 22:43:24.021834
End Time: 2025-01-04 22:43:25.574156
Duration: 0:00:01.552322
Total Executions: 2
Exceptions: 0
Regex Matches: 0
Number of successful commands executed upon regex match: 0
Number of failed executed commands upon regex match: 0  
Termination Reason: Manual termination by user
```

## üéõÔ∏è Example Commands <a id="example-commands"></a>

### Process Monitoring (babysit/watchdog mode)

```bash
python cli_monitor.py \
  --command "pgrep my_app || echo NOT_FOUND" \
  --frequency 10 \
  --regex "NOT_FOUND" \
  --regex-execute "bash /path/to/start_my_app.sh"
```

This command checks every 10 seconds if `my_app` is running. If not, it triggers a script to restart it.

### Repeating Echo

```bash
python cli_monitor.py --frequency 3 --command echo 'Checking System'
```

Prints "Checking System" every 3 seconds.

###  Log File Management

```bash
python cli_monitor.py --output-file memory_log.txt --max-log-size 5 --command echo 'Memory Status: OK'
```

Keeps logs within 5 KB by trimming older entries.

### Detecting Errors in Logs

```bash
python cli_monitor.py --command "cat /var/log/syslog" \
  --regex "error|fail" \
  --regex-execute "echo 'An issue was detected!'" \
  --timer 10
```

Runs for 10 seconds, searching for "error" or "fail" and executing an alert command when found.

## üí¨ Arguments Overview <a id="arguments-overview"></a>

| Argument         | Required? | Default | Description |
|-----------------|:---------:|--------:|-------------|
| `--command`      | Yes       | None    | The main command to run repeatedly. |
| `--output-file`  | No        | None    | Full path to a log file. If omitted, logs appear in the console only. |
| `--frequency`    | No        | 1.0     | Time interval in seconds between each execution (Min: 0.1; Max: 100000). |
| `--max-log-size` | No        | 1024    | Max log file size in KB. If exceeded, the script prunes oldest lines. |
| `--timer`       | No        | 0       | Stops automatically after N seconds. 0 means run indefinitely. |
| `--regex`       | No        | None    | A regex pattern to find in the command output. |
| `--regex-execute` | No       | None    | A command to run once per iteration if the regex pattern is matched. |

## üîÑ Automated Version Bumping, Testing and Release <a id="bumping"></a>

**GitHub Actions will:**
- [Run tests in several environments](https://github.com/Dimos082/cli-monitor/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml)
- Bump version in cli_monitor.py
-  Create a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Dimos082/cli-monitor/releases)
- Attach cli_monitor.py for download

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Dimos082/cli-monitor/tree/main/.github/workflows) automatically bumps versions when commit messages include specific keywords:
- Patch (X.Y.Z+1********) ‚Üí PATCH: Fixed issue
- Minor (X.Y+1.0********) ‚Üí MINOR: Added logging
- Major (X+1.0.0********) ‚Üí MAJOR: Breaking change

**Triggering a Release:**
To increment a patch number `1.0.1+`:
```bash
git commit -m "PATCH: Fixed issue in regex matching"
git push origin main
```
To increment major number `1+.0.0`, commit a major change:
```bash
git commit -m "MAJOR: Refactored CLI to use POSIX structure"
git push origin main
```

### Observer Design Pattern
Internally, cli_monitor.py uses an [Observer design pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer/python/example) to keep modules loosely coupled:

The controller (subject) runs commands, logs output, and notifies other modules (observers) like the RegexMonitor, ErrorHandler, and LoggerModule about data or events.
This structure makes the code more maintainable and extensible.
To add a new ‚Äúobserver‚Äù (e.g., a custom notification module), simply attach it to the flow in the controller without modifying existing logic significantly.
